# RDP-Scripts

Scripts that run or manipulate RDP sessions.


## StartRDP.ps1

PowerShell script to initiate a VPN connection and start an RDP session on a specified virtual desktop, and 
then teardown the VPN connection when the RDP session is closed. Its is a quick and dirty scripts that could 
be cleaned up to be parameterized and other niceties, but this works for my current purposes.
